About Me:

Hello! I am Kirsten, a visual designer from Michigan.

	I am currently pursuing a degree in Media and Information with minors in graphic design and Spanish from Michigan State University. I am passionate about using my design skills to help companies enhance their user interface and improve their user experience!  
	While in college, I have been given the opportunity to study abroad three times- Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Cuba! I have realized my passion for combining my design and language skills. Through my work, I am striving to be a part of something that will positively impact others.
